This home goes well beyond a sensational first impression. 
Upon entry, the first view is of the spiral staircase winding up to the master bedroom located on the upper floor of the turret. 
Directly below is the sweeping chef's kitchen that adjoins both the formal dining room and the expansive vaulted great room. 
Windows are everywhere, allowing for maximum natural lighting. With this breathtaking design you are guaranteed to impress even the toughest critic.

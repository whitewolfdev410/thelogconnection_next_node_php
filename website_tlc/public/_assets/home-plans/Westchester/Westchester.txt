The striking exterior of this executive-style home combines traditional log dormers with a grand glassed-in gable log truss. 
Inside, an expansive vaulted great room adjoins the kitchen and dining area. 
Upstairs are two undesignated loft areas perfect for future bedrooms, each with a private balcony and views to both the kitchen and great room below. 
This home is practical and graceful, providing the ultimate in elegance and relaxation.

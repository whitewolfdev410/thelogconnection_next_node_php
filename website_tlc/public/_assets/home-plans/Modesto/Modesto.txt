A grand, soaring vaulted Great Room is the the highlight of the many beautiful features of this home.  A huge, open living area, combined with a lavish Master Suite, a cozy Office or Den, and a two-car garage, occupy the entire main floor.  Downstairs are three generous bedrooms for children, in-laws, or guests, as well as a large Family Room.

Family is the focal point of this inviting log home. 
Featured on the main floor is an impressive country kitchen with long peninsula, looking through a large dining room with french doors to a covered porch. 
A see-through fireplace separates the living and dining areas, and is overlooked by the master suite. 
This home is perfect for sharing Christmas holidays and summer barbecues.

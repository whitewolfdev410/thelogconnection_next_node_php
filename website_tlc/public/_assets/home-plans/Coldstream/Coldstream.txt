A cozy getaway, this home proves that affordability and a taste of grandeur can come in a single package. 
An efficient L-shaped kitchen and eating bar adjoin the open living room. 
A log stair winds behind a soaring chimney to the loft, where a view of the main floor awaits. 
An expansive wrap-around deck invites easy outdoor living.

Classic Prairie Style design makes this home perfectly suited to a ranch or small acreage. 
The well-organized floor plan combines three bedrooms and a large living/dining room with a generous kitchen; all with vaulted ceilings. 
No stairs to climb, and the convenient detached garage would make a perfect workshop for a farm or home business. 
Enjoy the sun on the large main sundeck, or on the private deck of the master suite.

Steep, sweeping roof lines give an alpine flair to this character cottage.  
A convenient ground floor master suite accesses the covered deck through an angled french door.  
An L-shaped log stairway separates the kitchen/dining area from the vaulted Great room, and leads to a large upstairs loft and two charming bedrooms.

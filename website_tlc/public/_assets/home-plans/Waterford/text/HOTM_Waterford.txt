At the cutting edge of modern design, the Waterford features dramatic shed roofs, suspended balconies, and a large deck- details that make it perfect for a waterfront lot. A sweeping open plan main floor takes full advantage of the view, highlighted by a central open shaft that soars to a twenty five foot high vaulted ceiling.

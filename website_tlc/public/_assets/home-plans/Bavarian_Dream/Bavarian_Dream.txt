A home of splendor and distinction, the Bavarian Dream is one of our most sought after models. 
From the unique great room to the vaulted foyer and kitchen, this home impresses.  
Upstairs, the grand master suite and two bedrooms are connected by a walkway overlooking the foyer. 
Curving decks off the great room and upstairs master suite emphasize the form and grandeur of the design.

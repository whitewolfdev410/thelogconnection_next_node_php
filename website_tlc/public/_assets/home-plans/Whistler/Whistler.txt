Large picture windows on a graceful bow front make a fabulous first impression from the street, and inside flood the vaulted great room with sunlight. 
The dining area sweeps into an open kitchen where an angled center island commands views of the entire living area. 
Sliding glass doors to the sundeck are another bonus to a gracious master suite that boasts a walk-in closet and full ensuite. 
The unfinished loft on the upper floor is a perfect retreat from which to overlook the great room.

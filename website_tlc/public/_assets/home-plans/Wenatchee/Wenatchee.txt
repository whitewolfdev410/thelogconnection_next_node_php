A dramatic stone fireplace punctuates the windowed front gable of this charming chalet style home. 
This is a compact, efficient design that has no lack of space, with two bedrooms and a full bathroom on the main floor. 
The gorgeous kitchen features an L-shaped island and loads of counter space. 
The fireplace and stair rise in the vaulted great room, leading to a wide loft and the master suite upstairs with its own balcony.

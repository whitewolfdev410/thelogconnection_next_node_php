This stunning design has been our most popular home for several years running. 
The vaulted great room is a favorite highlight, whose focal point is a custom staircase wrapping around the fireplace. 
The spacious chef’s kitchen overlooks a formal dining room adjacent to the great room. 
The master suite includes a full ensuite and an impressive walk-in closet. 
Located upstairs are two bedrooms, a full bathroom and walkways that overlook the foyer, dining room and great room.

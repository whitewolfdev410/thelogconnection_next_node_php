This extraordinary home is perfect for the dynamic family. 
The gracious wrap around, U-shaped kitchen design is highlighted by the equally impressive dining room and spectacular vaulted great room. 
A walk-in closet and full ensuite are featured in the spacious master suite. The upper floor plan features four bedrooms, a loft and an upper patio. 
The attached double garage has plenty of space above for a home office or full in-law suite.

This charming home combines affordability with style. 
An open living area rises to a vaulted ceiling, with an L-shaped stair leading to the full master suite above. 
The spacious kitchen features an island with eating bar, and double french doors lead to the sundeck. 
Covered porches on each side and a large, sunny deck give you the best of both worlds.

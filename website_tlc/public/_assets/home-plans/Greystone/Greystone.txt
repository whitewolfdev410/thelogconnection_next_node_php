A striking feature of this grand estate is a double-sided masonry fireplace accessible from both the great room and outdoor patio. 
A generous kitchen adjoins a bayed nook and vaulted dining room, with french doors leading to a deck and lower patio. 
The separate mudroom is perfect for an active lifestyle; the skis and boots are convenient but out of sight. 
Upstairs, the master suite features a generous walk-in closet and five-piece ensuite. 
Abundant open loft areas enjoy views of both outdoors and the living areas below.

Multiple overlapping roof planes climax in a window wall that fills the front gable of this home. 
Grand chateau styling is tied together by a large sundeck. 
The large vaulted great room is overlooked by a generous loft, while the breakfast nook is an inviting spot to look at the view in three directions. 
The master suite is conveniently located on the main floor with access to the sundeck. 
All bedrooms have their own full ensuite bathroom, and the upper bedroom is suitable for a second master suite.

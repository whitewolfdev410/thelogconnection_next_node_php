A very compact home that combines the charm of a weekend cabin with plenty of space for a small family.
The main floor features a large bedroom with a private entrance and deck, plus a separate laundy room.
Upstairs, two bedrooms with their own private balconies adjoin a cozy loft overlooking the vaulted living and dining area.

A family oriented home, with entertaining in mind. 
The main floor plan has some extras: the double garage, covered entry and open main living area. 
Upstairs, the spacious master suite has a private balcony, walk-in closet and a full ensuite that will envelope you in luxurious solitude. 
A peaceful sitting room is just a few steps away from a veranda overlooking the main living area, giving this home a feeling of openness and warmth.

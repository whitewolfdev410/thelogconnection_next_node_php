An abundance of luxurious features is the signature of this design. 
A generous master suite, with complete ensuite bathroom and walk-in closet, occupies an entire wing of the home. 
A unique sunken living room is overlooked by the formal dining room; both with direct access to the wide sundeck. 
The spacious kitchen features a center island, curving peninsula, and large enclosed pantry.

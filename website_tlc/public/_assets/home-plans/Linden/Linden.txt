For such a compact footprint, it’s hard to believe this home features four generous bedrooms plus an open loft area.  Even the narrowest lot could be accommodated with  a slight modification to the side deck. The  kitchen-dining area opens to the living area featureing a vaulted ceiling with two stories of windows.

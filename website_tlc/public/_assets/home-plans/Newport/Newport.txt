A simple yet spacious floor plan makes the Newport one of our most affordable homes.
An open living area and vaulted ceiling provide a great feeling of space.  Three bedrooms plus a loft overlooking the living area provide plenty of space for a small family, or make a perfect weekend cottage for summer or winter getaways.

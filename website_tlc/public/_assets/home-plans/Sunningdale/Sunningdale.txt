Displaying a distinct European chalet influence, this home provides practical and functional living. 
The covered decks and back porch are a perfect place to hang up the skis before warming up by the fire. 
A focal point is the wrap around kitchen adjoining the vaulted living room and dining area. 
The master bedroom, conveniently located on the main floor, includes a private ensuite and walk-in closet. 
A staircase winds behind the fireplace to the upper bedrooms and spacious loft area.
